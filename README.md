# Advent of Code 2025

Just my thoughts on solving Advent of Code 2025 in C#.

See https://adventofcode.com/2025 for the puzzle descriptions.

I tried to do it with intuitive approaches and without going too deep into math and complex algorithms. My focus was on having fun, not producing production grade code :grin:

My inputs are not included (for reference see https://adventofcode.com/about -> `If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.`)
